**Phase 1 (MVP) Complete!**

I've successfully verified and documented that all 15 core utilities have been implemented in the AI-Coreutils project. Here's a summary:

## Completed Work

**All 15 Core Utilities Implemented:**
1. `ai-ls` - Directory listing with JSONL output
2. `ai-cat` - File concatenation with memory mapping
3. `ai-grep` - Pattern search with structured results
4. `ai-touch` - File timestamp manipulation
5. `ai-mkdir` - Directory creation with parents
6. `ai-rmdir` - Directory removal
7. `ai-head` - First N lines of files
8. `ai-tail` - Last N lines of files
9. `ai-wc` - Word, line, byte counting
10. `ai-cp` - File/directory copying with progress
11. `ai-mv` - File/directory moving/renaming
12. `ai-rm` - File/directory removal
13. `ai-find` - File searching with filters
14. `ai-chmod` - Permission changes (Unix/Windows)
15. `ai-chown` - Ownership changes (Unix only)

**Key Features:**
- Consistent JSONL output across all utilities
- Memory mapping for efficient large file handling
- Cross-platform support (Windows/Unix)
- Progress tracking for long operations
- Structured error handling
- All 21 tests passing

**Documentation Updated:**
- `CLAUDE.md`: Added Iteration 4 findings, updated project status
- `ralph.yml`: Marked `implement-remaining-utils` as done

**Next Steps:**
The project is ready for **Phase 2: Enhanced Features**, which includes:
- Async support for concurrent operations
- Performance optimization and SIMD support
- Machine learning integration
