Perfect! Now let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary

I've successfully completed the **ML Integration** task for AI-Coreutils (Phase 3, Task 2). Here's what was accomplished:

### New Module: `ml_ops.rs`
Created a comprehensive machine learning operations module with:

1. **PatternDetector** - Regex-based pattern matching for 12+ common data types:
   - Email addresses
   - URLs/URIs
   - IP addresses (IPv4)
   - Phone numbers
   - Credit card numbers
   - Social Security Numbers
   - Dates and timestamps
   - Hexadecimal values
   - Base64 encoded data
   - UUIDs
   - File paths
   - Custom patterns

2. **FileClassifier** - Intelligent file type detection:
   - Extension-based classification (20+ file types)
   - Content-based binary detection
   - Programming language detection (15+ languages)
   - MIME type identification

3. **ContentAnalysis** - Comprehensive text analysis:
   - Text statistics (lines, words, characters, bytes)
   - Shannon entropy calculation for encrypted/compressed file detection
   - Pattern grouping and counting
   - Issue detection (sensitive data patterns, high entropy)

### New Utility: `ai-analyze`
A full-featured AI-powered file analysis tool with flags:
- `--patterns` / `-p` - Enable pattern detection
- `--classify` / `-c` - Enable file classification
- `--statistics` / `-s` - Show detailed statistics
- `--recursive` / `-r` - Recursive directory analysis
- `--verbose` / `-v` - Verbose output with individual pattern matches
- `--min-confidence` / `-m` - Set confidence threshold (0.0 to 1.0)

### Test Results
- ✅ All 42 tests passing (36 library + 5 integration + 1 doc)
- ✅ 10 new ML-specific tests
- ✅ Project builds successfully in release mode

### Dependencies Added
- `regex = "1.10"` - For efficient pattern matching

### Files Modified
1. `src/ml_ops.rs` - New ML operations module (730+ lines)
2. `src/bin/ai-analyze.rs` - New analysis utility (260+ lines)
3. `src/lib.rs` - Updated to include ml_ops module
4. `Cargo.toml` - Added regex dependency and ai-analyze binary
5. `CLAUDE.md` - Updated with ML integration learnings and patterns
6. `.ralph/ralph.yml` - Marked ML integration as complete
7. `.ralph/scratchpad.md` - Updated with iteration notes

RALPH_STATUS:
STATUS: COMPLETE
CURRENT_TASK: add-ml-integration
TASKS_COMPLETED_THIS_LOOP: 7
FILES_MODIFIED: 7
TESTS_STATUS: PASSING (42/42)
WORK_TYPE: IMPLEMENTATION
EXIT_SIGNAL: false
RECOMMENDATION: ML integration complete! Phase 3 has 2 tasks done (SIMD + ML), only cross-language bindings remain (optional/low priority). Project is feature-complete for MVP + Enhanced + Polish phases.
