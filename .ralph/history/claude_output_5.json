{"type":"result","subtype":"success","is_error":false,"duration_ms":43107,"duration_api_ms":37261,"num_turns":6,"result":"The changes are primarily to the `.claude/skills/` directory (skill files have been restructured from `.md` files to directories) and `.ralph/` history files. These are infrastructure/agent-related changes.\n\nLooking at the project state:\n- All 12 tasks are complete (100%)\n- All 47 tests passing\n- All phases done (Phase 1, 2, 3)\n- The uncommitted changes are to agent infrastructure files, not the core project code\n\nSince there are no active tasks and all work is complete, I'll provide a status summary:\n\n---\n\n**PROJECT STATUS: COMPLETE** 🎉\n\nThe AI-Coreutils project is fully implemented with all phases and tasks complete:\n\n**Summary:**\n- **12/12 tasks** complete (100%)\n- **47/47 tests** passing (41 library + 5 integration + 1 doc)\n- **16 utilities** implemented (ls, cat, grep, find, cp, mv, rm, touch, mkdir, rmdir, head, tail, wc, chmod, chown, analyze)\n- **All phases** complete:\n  - ✅ Phase 1: MVP (15 core utilities)\n  - ✅ Phase 2: Async operations support\n  - ✅ Phase 3: Polish & Scale (SIMD, ML integration, cross-language bindings, documentation)\n\n**Outstanding Items:**\n- Uncommitted changes to `.claude/skills/` infrastructure (skill files restructured from .md to directories)\n- `.ralph/` history files with session data\n\n**Recommendation:** The project is feature-complete and production-ready. The uncommitted changes are related to agent infrastructure (skills reorganization) and session history, not the core ai-coreutils codebase.\n\n---RALPH_STATUS---\nSTATUS: COMPLETE\nCURRENT_TASK: No active task\nTASKS_COMPLETED_THIS_LOOP: 0\nSUBTASKS_MARKED_COMPLETE: []\nFILES_MODIFIED: 0 (changes are to agent infrastructure only)\nTESTS_STATUS: PASSING (47/47: 41 library + 5 integration + 1 doc)\nWORK_TYPE: MAINTENANCE\nEXIT_SIGNAL: true\nRECOMMENDATION: Project is complete - all tasks done, all tests passing.
