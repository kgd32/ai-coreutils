## Summary

I have completed the cross-language bindings for AI-Coreutils:

### Python Bindings (PyO3)
- Created `src/python.rs` with full Python API exposure
- Added `python` feature to Cargo.toml (uses PyO3 0.22 for Python 3.13 support)
- Created Python examples: memory_access.py, pattern_detection.py, file_classification.py
- Created python/README.md with complete documentation

### Node.js Bindings (NAPI-RS)
- Created `nodejs/src/lib.rs` with full JavaScript API exposure
- Added nodejs/package.json and Cargo.toml for NAPI build
- Created Node.js examples: memory.js, pattern-detection.js, file-classification.js
- Created nodejs/README.md with complete documentation

### Documentation
- Created `docs/bindings.md` with comprehensive bindings guide

### All Tests Passing
- 41/41 tests passing (36 library + 5 integration)
- Project compiles successfully

**Phase 3 (Polish & Scale) is now COMPLETE!** The AI-Coreutils project has:
- ✅ 15 core utilities (GNU compatible)
- ✅ Async support for concurrent operations
- ✅ SIMD optimizations (AVX2/SSE2)
- ✅ ML integration (pattern detection, file classification)
- ✅ Cross-language bindings (Python + Node.js)
