## Summary

I've completed implementation of the remaining utilities for the AI-Coreutils project:

### Utilities Implemented

1. **ai-rm** - File/directory removal with:
   - Recursive removal support (`-r`)
   - Force mode (`-f`)
   - Interactive mode (`-i`)
   - Root directory protection
   - JSONL output with statistics

2. **ai-find** - File search with:
   - Pattern matching (name, type, size, extension, permissions)
   - Depth control (`-maxdepth`, `-mindepth`)
   - Wildcard support in name patterns
   - Type filtering (file, directory, symlink)
   - Size filtering with K/M/G suffixes
   - JSONL output with file metadata

3. **ai-chmod** - Permission modification with:
   - Octal mode support (755, 644, etc.)
   - Symbolic mode support (u+x, go=rwx, etc.)
   - Recursive permission changes (`-R`)
   - Platform-specific implementations (Unix/Windows)
   - JSONL output with before/after permissions

4. **ai-chown** - Ownership modification with:
   - User/group specification (user:group format)
   - Recursive ownership changes (`-R`)
   - Platform-specific (Unix only, Windows outputs info message)
   - JSONL output with ownership statistics

### Project Status

**Total utilities: 15/15 implemented**
- ai-ls, ai-cat, ai-grep (already done)
- ai-touch, ai-mkdir, ai-rmdir (already done)
- ai-head, ai-tail, ai-wc (already done)
- ai-cp, ai-mv (already done, fixed compilation errors)
- ai-rm, ai-find, ai-chmod, ai-chown (implemented this session)

### Compilation & Tests

- All 15 binaries compile successfully
- All tests pass (21/21: 15 library + 5 integration + 1 doc)
- Only minor warnings about platform-specific unused code (expected on Windows)

The `implement-remaining-utils` task from ralph.yml is now complete.
