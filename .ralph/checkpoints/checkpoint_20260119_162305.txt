State: null

Project Status:
- Tasks Completed: 0
- Completion: null%
- Files Modified: [count from git]

Next Steps:
**Last Commit**: (pending)

## Performance Targets
- Memory mapping: Works well for large files
- JSONL overhead: Minimal
- All utilities: Fast and efficient

## Next Agent Should
1. Continue implementing remaining utilities (cp, mv, rm, find, chmod, chown)
2. Start with moderate complexity (cp, mv, rm)
3. Save complex ones for last (find, chmod, chown)
4. Test and verify functionality
5. Update documentation and commit

## Important Reminders
- Always reference gnu-core-utils.md as blueprint
- Auto-documentation is ALWAYS enabled (no manual invocation needed)
- Update ralph.yml task status before starting
- Commit after each task completion
- Phase 1 (MVP) is progressing well - 9/15 utilities done
